/**
 This property adjusts the sensitivity for detecting the phrase 
 "OK Hound"
 
 Valid values are in the range 0.0-1.0. With lower values the phrase
 spotter will trigger more frequently, capturing the wakeup phrase
 more often, but with increased chance for false positives.
 
 Conversely, with higher values the phrase spotter will trigger less
 frequently, possibly missing the wakeup phrase more often, but with
 a lower false positive rate.

/**
 An informational value which shows highest confidence score reached
 by the phrase spotter for any single frame of audio since the last
 reset.
 
 Confidence scores are in the range 0.0-1.0
 
 This value is independent of whether a phrase is spotted. That is,
 the max confidence score will increase with each new high water mark
 regardless of whether the confidence score has exceeded the
 threshold.  This is useful information for tuning the phrase spotter
 sensitivity, and has no effect on phrase spotter functionality.

 @note The max confidence must be reset to 0.0 explicitly by calling
 -resetOkHoundMaxConfidenceScore. It will NOT reset if a phrase is
 spotted.  This allows the max confidence value to be tracked across
 any duration of audio, regardless of how many times it contains the
 target phrase.
